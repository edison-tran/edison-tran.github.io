        <h2> Program Description</h2>
            <p>
                At TMU, the Business Technolgy Management program is able to provide students with both core business concepts,
                coupled with technical capabilities.<br> Reinforcement and an understanding of how business processes are able to 
                work cohesively with the necessary technology solutions in order to establish<br> progression in terms of these
                two aspects. Essentially, technological advancements capitalize on the business processes and ideas that are
                presented to them.<br> One course that was a foundational course, in that it was extremely useful in realizing
                the future of this sector was ITM-200, which was Fundamentals to Programming.<br> What was so important about
                this course was, seeing that BTM covers both business and technological aspects, it help me realize that 
                I prefer learning about the<br>technical and coding aspects of the sector.

                        was introduced to me during middle school; due to its natural intensity and high-pace
                        style, I enjoyed it so much that I joined the after school program.

                        was an extra-curricular that I had been made aware of during the later half of high school.
                        Like most students, I had joined DECA in hopes to strengthen my chances of getting into
                        certain university programs, which I ended up getting accepted into.
